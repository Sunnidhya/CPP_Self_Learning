Data Structures are containers which holds data to be processed 
or stored for various operations

PseudoCode is the best way to convey the logic of a given problem
 at hand and best it is independent of any programming language. 

int/int = int, it drops the values after decimal this happens in
Java and C++. Either of numerator or denomicator should be float
to get the fractional value.

Diving Deeper:
1) Preprocessor Directive: the preprocessors are the directives/statements
which gives instruction to the compiler to preprocess some piece of code
before actual compilations start. It begins with #, after the code is 
included in the code we have written the actual process of compilation
starts.
